      Do you wonder how an Angular application starts? Do you wonder about what
      happens behind the scenes? Dear reader, this article is for you! The story
      starts from a file. Oh yeah, every angular application starts thanks to
      the angular.json. It's not the application's entry door, but an Angular
      app starts thanks to this configuration file.
    </p>
    <h2>What's the entry point?</h2>
    <p>
      If you are using an old version of Angular such as Angular 4 or 5, you'll
      notice that you don't have this file. Instead, you have angular-cli.json.
      No worries, it the same file! It just got renamed in the recent versions
      of Angular. The angular.json contains all the configurations of the app.
      The Angular builder will look at this file to find the entry door of the
      application. Good, we found the entry ^^ Now, let's dive in and see what
      this file contains. Here is an example of an angular.json example:
    </p>
    <code data-gist-id="d11531c7399ce827403fb3ad24fdffe4"></code>
    <p>
      This file is like human DNA. We know based on this file which UI library
      we are using, the builder we use to build the app, the path to the index
      file, path to the polyfills, the type of the compiler, the assets we are
      using, and so on. üëÄNote: By the way, I usually start by looking at this
      file and the package.json file whenever I start a new mission with a new
      Angular app. It gives me a global view of initial information about the
      app. Sometimes, you can also detect if there are some strange things in
      the app (ex. having multiple UI libraries in the styles' array ). You can
      expect then that the app may need some cleaning. In the build section,
      you'll find the main option. This is where we specify the entry to the
      application by providing the path of the <code>main.ts</code> file. So
      this file is mandatory to start the app. If you have created the app by
      using the Angular CLI, everything will be set and generated for you.
    </p>
    <h2>The <code>main.js</code></h2>
    <code data-gist-id="b745706ad703a0cc3e7dbf7459d905d7"></code>
    <p>
      As you can see, this file's job is to create a browser environment for the
      application. Followed by the call of the bootstrapModule. After then, the
      app is bootstrapped. Wait a minute. I skipped something. Nah? How is the
      app being bootstrapped, and what's even bootstrapped?
    </p>
    <code data-gist-id="de5e113f890cda3fda83411a2188e54b"></code>
    <h2>App's door is open. What's bootstrapping?</h2>
    <p>
      Every application has at least one Angular module. The root module that
      you bootstrap to launch the application is called a bootstrapping module.
      Thus, bootstrapping is a mechanism or a technique of loading and launching
      an Angular application. It's when we load the component or the module that
      will be rendered. Now that we found the door. The main.ts have done its
      job by executing the step below by the builder:
    </p>
    <code>platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)</code>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that we pass in the AppModule. The real app code!
      Yes, in fact, this is the code that contains our application. The
      AppModule is nothing but all declarations, components, services, and all
      the code related to our app. Let's check the famous AppModule file:
    </p>
    <code data-gist-id="641691d62a70c06e6f4ec007647409e6"></code>
    <p>
      In the App module, at @NgModule decorator array, we have a bootstrap
      Array. Here the bootstrap component is provided or added, so at this
      point, Angular loads AppComponent. But, you may wonder, from the root
      component to a working page, that something is missing. Nah? How is it
      read and understood by the browser? The browser only knows HTML, CSS, and
      JS, right? The app is coded in Typescript. So there is something else that
      happens.
    </p>
    <h2>App's home is open. How do we open a room inside?</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of the app.component.ts file:</p>
    <code data-gist-id="b1dbb6b4379b86421d66e8b5a56b3190"></code>
    <p>Each component is declared with three properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Selector ‚Äî used for accessing the component</li>
      <li>2. Template/TemplateURL ‚Äî contains HTML of the component</li>
      <li>3. StylesURL ‚Äî contains component-specific stylesheets</li>
    </ul>
    After this,
    <p>
      Angular calls the index.html file. By the way, Angular is a framework that
      allows us to create ‚ÄúSingle Page Applications‚Äù, and here the index.html is
      the single page that was provided by the server.<br />
      This file consequently calls the root component that is app-root. The root
      component is defined in app.component.ts. This is how the index.html file
      looks:
    </p>
    <code data-gist-id="966f4e69c05eefb1ebc47bfd067303c1"></code>
    <p>
      The HTML template of the root component is displayed inside the app-root
      tags. Okay, right now, we know how the main page or home page is rendered.
      How are other pages and other components rendered? First, index.html is
      always rendered. Whatever we do, t's the index.html that is the main
      template. What changes is what's inside the app-root tags based on the
      URL. And here comes the app.routing.module.ts to the scenes. The
      corresponding component to the typed URL will be rendered inside the
      app-root tags and so on thanks to the Router-outlet inside the
      app.component.html template:
    </p>
    <code data-gist-id="35443ea480294dee91f8011cc16af695"></code>
